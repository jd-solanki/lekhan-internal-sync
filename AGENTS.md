- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## GitHub

- Your primary method for interactive with GitHub should be GitHub CLI

## Feature Development/Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the question extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of the concision.
- Always use relevant <skill>/SKILL.md files to guide your plans and implementations.
- Always use Context7 MCP for library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps

## Coding Guidelines

- Readable & Modular code
- Follow DRY & KISS principle
- Use `na nuxt prepare` before checking type issues to regenerate types
- Add comments for What & Why. Avoid comments which I can infer from code (How)
- Minimal code changes to achieve the goal
